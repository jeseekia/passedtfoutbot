# PassedTFOutBot

## Description
Sometimes life is hard and sleeping is inevitable even for the chosen ones. When life gets the best of you, this bot will help keep your community updated so you don't seem like a complete flake.

The long-term idea is that PTFOB will check if you are live based on your streaming schedule. If you are not, it will text you to verify if you are awake. You can respond with how long it'll be before you start streaming. If you do not respond, it will notify your viewers via some social media platform such as Twitter or Discord.


## Todo
- Setup repo
- Create a bot account on Twitch
- Create a starter bot using API docs
- Check if streamer is live (automate eventually)
- "Page" streamer
- Listen to streamer response
  - Alert viewers of streamer response
  - Alert viewers that streamer is ptfo


## Potential Technologies
- Twitch API
- Twilio API
- Discord API
